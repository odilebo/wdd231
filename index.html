                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I’m a curious and motivated postgraduate student with a passion for learning, problem-solving, and making meaningful connections. I’m currently pursuing a Postgraduate Diploma in Data Science at the University of the Witwatersrand, where I’m sharpening my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and critical thinking.
                  I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think differently and push me out of my comfort zone — whether it's collaborating with a team, presenting ideas, or diving deep into complex data. I believe in lifelong learning and personal growth, and I’m always open to opportunities that help me grow both personally and professionally. 
                  Outside of academics, I’m someone who values integrity, creativity, and staying curious about the world. I’m excited about where this journey will take me and always looking forward to connecting with others who share a passion for learning and making a difference.
                  I’m passionate about finding creative ways to solve problems and bring ideas to life. As a student, I’ve learned the value of persistence, adaptability, and working with others toward a common goal. Whether it’s tackling a challenging project, learning a new skill, or stepping up in leadership roles, I believe in giving my best and staying open to growth. Beyond academics, I enjoy engaging with new perspectives, collaborating on meaningful initiatives, and continuously challenging myself to improve.</p>
